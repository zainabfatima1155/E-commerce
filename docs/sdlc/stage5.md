# Stage 5: Testing

## Overview:

In this stage, the developed system will be tested to ensure it functions as expected and meets the specified requirements.

### Types of Testing:

- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components and functions for correct behavior (e.g., React components, backend API routes).
- **Integration Testing**: Testing how well the frontend and backend work together (e.g., making API calls from the frontend and verifying data in the backend).
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: The system will be tested by end-users to ensure it meets their needs.

### Tools:

- **Frontend**: Jest, React Testing Library for unit tests.
- **Backend**: Mocha/Chai for backend API testing.
- **Database**: Testing with sample data to ensure triggers and data consistency work.

### Progress:

Testing is yet to begin, but we plan to write unit and integration tests after implementing core features.
