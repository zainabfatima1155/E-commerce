# Stage 2: Feasibility Study

## Overview:

In this stage, we assess whether the project can be successfully developed and deployed considering the requirements, available resources, and constraints.

### Technical Feasibility:

- **Frontend**: React and TypeScript are a solid choice for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Backend**: Express.js is lightweight and scalable, and Prisma provides an excellent ORM for interacting with the SQL database.
- **Database**: SQL is an ideal choice to store and manage customer data, orders, inventory, and transactions.

### Operational Feasibility:

- The system will allow users to place orders and manage products efficiently.
- The integration with the payment gateway will provide a secure and smooth transaction process.

### Legal Feasibility:

- No legal constraints are foreseen, as the project will comply with general data protection and security standards (GDPR, PCI DSS for payment processing).
